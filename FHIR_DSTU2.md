# FHIR DSTU2 Resources

The CQL Testing framework supports all FHIR DSTU2 resource types.
It provides this support by dynamically referencing the formal FHIR definitions of
each resource, ensuring that specified fields in the YAML file are valid fields for
that resource.

## Patient References, Default Values, and Aliases

The CQL Testing Framework attempts to automatically set the appropriate patient
reference on data instances (based on the resource type).  This means that the test
author does not need to manually set the patient reference unless they wish to
override the default.

In addition, the CQL Testing Framework will set default values for certain fields
when the author does not provide a value.  Determining what the default value should be
is a subjective exercise, but the CQL Testing Framework team has tried to assign default
values that makes sense in most cases.  In cases where an author does not want the
default value they can override it with another value or with `null` in cases where
they want no value at all.

Last, in a few cases, the CQL Testing Framework allows test authors to use an alias
field name.  This is mainly useful for simplifying the data (e.g., allowing for `code`
rather than `medicationCodeableConcept`).

This documentation clearly indicates what the default patient reference field is,
what fields will be set with default values, and what aliases are allowed.

## ImagingObjectSelection

A manifest of a set of DICOM Service-Object Pair Instances (SOP Instances).  The referenced SOP Instances (images or other content) are for a single patient, and may be from one or more studies. The referenced SOP Instances have been selected for a purpose, such as quality assurance, conference, or consult. Reflecting that range of purposes, typical ImagingObjectSelection resources may include all SOP Instances in a study (perhaps for sharing through a Health Information Exchange); key images from multiple studies (for reference by a referring or treating physician); a multi-frame ultrasound instance ("cine" video clip) and a set of measurements taken from that instance (for inclusion in a teaching file); and so on.

<a name="MedicationStatement"></a>
## MedicationStatement

A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now, or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from e.g. the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.


|     | Field | Description |
| --- | ----- | ----------- |
| Patient Reference | patient | The person or animal who is/was taking the medication. |
| Default Value | status | A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of the medication used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be active or completed. <br /> **Default:** _active_ |
