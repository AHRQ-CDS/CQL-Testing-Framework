# in reusable_resources.yml and consists of two Condition resources, both of which will be 
# imported into this test case.

  # To check for strict equality, simply list desired output objects under `results`.
  # Can also verify certain output object properties by using `$should` expressions.
  # The following indicates that the Summary object should exist.
  Summary: $should exist
  # The following indicates that these outputs should be arrays of length 1
  ReportConditionsAssociatedWithChronicPain: $should have length 1
