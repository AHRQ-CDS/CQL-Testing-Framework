# The `allFrom` keyword will cause all referenced resources to be included.
-
  allFrom: *painRelatedConditions
# The `iterateOver` keyword will cause a set of test cases to be created, each containing 
# a different one of the referenced resources.
-
  iterateOver: *nonOpioidMedicationOrders
-
  iterateOver: *nonOpioidMedicationStatements


results:
  # Cannot check for strict equality in this example, since each test case created by 
  # `iterateOver` has a different output summary.
  
  # Must verify certain output object properties by listing them under `outputShould`.
  outputExpectedTo:
    # The following indicates that the Summary object should exist.
    Summary: exist
    # The following indicates that the these outputs should be arrays of length 1
    ReportConditionsAssociatedWithChronicPain: have length 1
    ReportRiskFactorsForOpioidRelatedHarms: have length 1
    ReportNonOpioidMedications: have length 2
