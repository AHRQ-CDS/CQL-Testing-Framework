name: Second example of using reusable resources

# Referenced resources don't have to be included in the test case file. They can exist
# in separate YAML files as long as they are named under externalData.
externalData:
- reusable_resources
- more_resources

data:
-
  resourceType: Patient
  name: Fuller Jackson
  gender: male
  birthDate: 1954-02-16
# The `$import` keyword will cause all resources in the referenced external YAML file
# to be included in this test case. In the example below painRelatedConditions is contained
# in reusable_resources.yml and consists of two Condition resources, both of which will be
# imported into this test case.
-
  $import: *painRelatedConditions
# The `$iterate` keyword will cause a set of test cases to be created, each containing
# just one of the resources in the referenced external YAML file. In the example below
# nonOpioidMedicationRequests is contained in more_resources.yml and consists of two
# MedicationRequest resources, from which two separate test cases are generated, each
# with one of the MedicationRequest resources. Both test cases will include everything from
# painRelatedConditions.
-
  $iterate: *nonOpioidMedicationRequests
# There can be more than one usage of the `$iterate` keyword in a single file, in which
# case the effects are combined to generate all possible combination of resources. In the
# example below, nonOpioidMedicationStatements is contained in more_resources.yml and consists
# of two MedicationStatement resources. A total of 2*2=4 separate test cases are created
# consisting of all possible combinations of resources from nonOpioidMedicationRequests and
# nonOpioidMedicationStatements. All test cases will include everything from painRelatedConditions.
-
  $iterate: *nonOpioidMedicationStatements


results:
  # Cannot check for strict equality in this example, since each test case created by
  # `$iterate` has a different output Summary object.

  # Must verify certain output object properties by using `$should` expressions.
  # The following indicates that the Summary object should exist.
  Summary: $should exist
  # The following indicates that the these outputs should be arrays of length 1
  ReportConditionsAssociatedWithChronicPain: $should have length 1
  ReportRiskFactorsForOpioidRelatedHarms: $should have length 1
  # The following indicates that the this output should be an array of length 2
  ReportNonOpioidMedications: $should have length 2
